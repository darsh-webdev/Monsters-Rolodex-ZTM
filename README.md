# Monsters-Rolodex-ZTM
Created as a part of the Complete React Developer Course by Zero To Mastery. This is simple website that has a list of monster cards with their Image, Name and Email made using React.js

You can search for a particular monster through their name and the website will filter the list out and render the card of only the monster/monsters who name matches with the string in the search box.
